# VirtualBusinessCard

Developed as part of my master thesis, Virtual Business Card, is an iOS app which aims to replace the traditional paper business card. 

As part of the academic research conducted for my thesis, this project is not a fully complete product but rather a prototype used for testing. 

Some of the features of the app include:
- Storage of data in Firebase non relational database
- Business card models rendered in 3D using SceneKit to provide realistic texturing and lighting 
- Exchange of business cards with other users using QR codes. 
- Storage and organization of the received cards in a collection
